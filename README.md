# WPDebloatCollection
A collection of PHP snippets that debloat, declutter, cleanup Wordpress, or improve functionality. Examples include disabling unused features, removing nags and notices, or improving security (removing login errors, etc). These snippets must be added to a PHP snippets plugin or added to your functions.php (not recommend). Using a snippets plugin will give you control over where they run, and can be configured to run certain snippets only on specific pages, only in backend, or based only on certain conditons.
