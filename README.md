# WPDebloatCollection
A collection of scripts / snippets that debloat, declutter, and cleanup Wordpress; such as disabling unused features, removing nags and notices, or improve security (remove all login errors, login shake, etc). They are meant to be saved into a WP php snippets plugin. We recommend purchasing WP Snippets Pro. These could also work by copying and pasting into the functions.php, however, you won't have control over where the snippets run, which can cause more bloat in some instances. A good plugin can be configured to run certain snippets only on backend pages, on specific pages, and the code won't run if the conditons are not matched. This is what I recommend.

##**Scripts / PHP Snippets.**

### remove_spam_admin_notices
Filters spam admin notices and removes or hides them. Examples include activation, subscription, and "buy premium" nags.
